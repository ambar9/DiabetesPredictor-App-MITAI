# Diabetes Predictor App

This repository contains the source code for a diabetes predictor mobile application developed using MIT App Inventor.

## Overview

The Diabetes Predictor App utilizes a machine learning model trained on a diabetes dataset to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on certain input parameters. The model is implemented using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

## Features

- Input interface to provide user information (e.g., glucose level, blood pressure, etc.).
- Integration with the SVM model for diabetes prediction.
- Display of prediction results to the user.
